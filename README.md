# EV3-range-meter

## Description: 
This is a universal Lego Mindstorms EV3 compatible sensor. The first sensor feature is a range meter using the range meter VL53L0X.
It's based around a Particle Photon with Wi-Fi on board that emulates a EV3 UART sensor when connected to the EV3 brick.
In this iteration the sensor will be automatically detected as an ultrasonic sensor on Port 1. It provides the distance of the first obstacke in either centimeters or inches.

## Hardware: 
Particle Photon
ST Microelectronics VL53L0X time of flight proximity sensor
Dexter Industries EV3 connector adapter
SparkFun Proto board for Photon
